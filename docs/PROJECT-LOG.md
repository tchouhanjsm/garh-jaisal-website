| Release boundary | Originals untouched; no cPanel upload, staging deployment or production deployment |

## Recent guest-journey milestones

- **PR #145 — homepage and arrival hierarchy:** reduced repeated promotion, improved page rhythm and restored detailed arrival guidance.
- **PR #146 — room comparison:** two-to-three-room comparison dialog and preservation of existing room/rate destinations.
- **PR #147 — room shortlist to Contact:** registry-validated multi-room enquiry with safe retry continuity.
- **PR #148 — room comparison to Trip:** grouped room options enter the shared tab-only Trip tray while separate choices remain selectable.
- **PR #149 — Trip to Contact + experience details:** mixed shortlist Contact fallback, room-option server resolution and full experience-detail links from desert/guided-tour hubs.
- **PR #150 — dining to shared Trip:** same validated `rooftop-dining` selection across restaurant, rooftop and catalogue pages, through to Contact. The corrected head passed all four required workflows.

## Sprint 72 — measured responsive hero-image budgets

The PR #150 Browser E2E artifact measured the local PHP site across 37 sitemap routes, with 149 unique rendered image URLs and 118 images reporting measurable Resource Timing size. These are local browser observations—not production/CDN or Core Web Vitals measurements.

The two largest responsive candidates were `img/responsive/v2/facade-1200.webp` at 416,592 bytes and `img/responsive/v2/courtyard-1200.webp` at 406,736 bytes. Sprint 72 adds narrowly scoped WebP quality overrides of 74 for those two sources while leaving the manifest default quality at 82. Original photographs stay unchanged.

Browser E2E will enforce a 350 KiB exact-file-size budget on both 1200px derivatives and include their byte evidence in the payload-audit report. The CI-generated visual review sheet must be checked at full image size; a passing byte budget alone is not image-quality approval.

## Verification boundary

- Run and inspect exact-head PHP 7.4/8.2, Browser E2E/screenshots, package preflight and non-deploying Staging QA.
- Image payload and timing data from local Chromium is a comparative engineering baseline, not evidence of production transfer behaviour or Core Web Vitals.
- No deployment is authorized by CI.

## Remaining owner-controlled release blockers

| Priority | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Host validation | HTTPS staging, deployed package SHA, PHP/Apache behavior, CAPTCHA and mail delivery require real-host verification. |
| P1 | Business-content approval | Menu/prices/hours, policies/privacy, check-in/reception, room rates and verified review quotations need owner approval. |
| P2 | Human design/accessibility review | Review exact-head artifacts at 320/390/768/1280/1440px, keyboard/focus, contrast, reduced motion and assistive technology. |
| P1 | Production release | No deployment performed; owner approval remains mandatory. |
